	<p id="para1">Vinicio Hernandez was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on August 16, 1934. From a very young age he started his first business,by selling avocadoes from his home, followed by a self-made caramel company (while studying), shoe-making. After finishing his high school studies, he graduated from a television workshop in New York where he later photographed various Dominican presidents; among them, he worked alongside Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, Joaquin Balaguer, and Juan Bosch. He also photographed politicians visiting the DR: Romulo Betancourt (Venezuela), Fulgencio Batista (Cuba), Adolfo Lopez Mateo (Mexico), Lyndon B. Johnson (USA).

He later founded a movie-filming company "Producciones Nuevo Mundo" where the first Dominican film was produced. He later created the Editora Tele-3, a printing company where he printed the first TV guide in the DR (1970), magazine Club de Rotarios (1978), and later printed ads for numerous companies throughout the country. He then created the Marketing degree in universities, which he later became one of the first graduates from the program.</p>
